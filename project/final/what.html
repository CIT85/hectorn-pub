            <h2>Key Points About Light Pollution</h2>
            <p>On our <a href="index.html">main</a> page, we listed the following points about light pollution, but here
                is an deeper look at what we are discussing when it comes to the effects</p>
            <h3><mark>Glare:</mark></h3>
            <p> Intense brightness from poorly shielded lights that can be uncomfortable or
                even hazardous, like when driving at night and encountering bright lights from oncoming vehicles.
            </p>
            <h3><mark>SkyGlow:</mark></h3>
            <p>The brightening of the night sky over inhabited areas due to the
                scattering of artificial light by particles and gases in the atmosphere, which reduces visibility of
                stars and celestial objects.</p>
            <h3><mark>Light Trespass:</mark></h3>
            <p>Unwanted or excessive artificial light that spills over into areas
                where it is not needed or wanted, such as into residential homes from nearby streetlights or
                commercial buildings.</p>
            <h3><mark>Clutter:</mark></h3>
            <p>Overabundance of light fixtures or signs in urban areas, leading to a
                visually chaotic environment and wasted energy.</p>
            <h3><mark>Disruption of ecosystems:</mark></h3>
            <p>Artificial light at night can disrupt the behaviors and
                habitats of wildlife, affecting their natural rhythms, migration patterns, and reproduction cycles.
