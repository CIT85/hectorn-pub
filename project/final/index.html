                <h2>What is Light Pollution?</h2>
                <p>
                    <mark>Light pollution</mark> occurs when excessive artificial light is present in the environment,
                    often from streetlights, buildings, or other sources. This extra light can cause problems like
                    blocking
                    our view of stars and disrupting the natural rhythms of plants and animals. It's kind of like when
                    you're trying to look at something in the dark, but someone shines a bright light in your eyes,
                    making
                    it hard to see.
                </p>
