                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Light pollution has been a recognized issue since the widespread adoption of electric lighting in the
                    late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, its significant impacts on human health, wildlife,
                    astronomy, and the environment have become more evident and widely acknowledged in the past few
                    decades.

                    Understanding both short-term and long-term effects is crucial for assessing the full impact of
                    Light
                    Pollution, and for making informed decisions about how to address them.</p>

                            <td>Artificial light at night can interfere with our natural sleep cycles, making it harder
                                to
                                fall asleep and stay asleep. This disruption can lead to tiredness, irritability, and
                                difficulty concentrating the next day.</td>

                            <td>Excessive artificial light can create glare and reduce visibility, especially for

                                night. Glare from bright lights can make it difficult to see clearly, increasing the
                                risk of
                                accidents and reducing overall safety.</td>

                                hunting.
                                Light pollution can confuse them, leading to disorientation, altered behaviors, and

                                reproduction, and migration patterns of animals. It can also alter plant growth cycles
                                and
                                affect the balance of predator-prey relationships, ultimately leading to ecosystem

                                astronomers to study and observe celestial objects. It limits our understanding of the
                                universe and hampers efforts to explore and discover new phenomena beyond Earth.</td>
